abstract = {Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) is a routine method for overcoming the phase problem when solving macromolecular structures. This technique requires the accurate measurement of intensities to determine differences between Bijvoet pairs. Although SAD experiments are commonly conducted at cryogenic temperatures to mitigate the effects of radiation damage, such temperatures can alter the conformational ensemble of the protein and may impede the merging of data from multiple crystals due to non-uniform freezing. Here, a strategy is presented to obtain high-quality data from room-temperature, single-crystal experiments. To illustrate the strengths of this approach, native SAD phasing at 6.55keV was used to solve four structures of three model systems at 295K. The resulting data sets allow automatic phasing and model building, and reveal alternate conformations that reflect the structure of proteins at room temperature.},

As indicated in its name, all calculation procedures are performed with the SHELXC/D/E program package. SHELIXIR provides screening for alternative space groups, optimal solvent content, and high- and low-resolution limits. The procedures of SHELXE are parallelized to minimize the computational time. The automation and parallelization of such procedures are suitable for phasing at synchrotron beamlines directly or for finding the optimal parameters for further data processing. A simple graphical interface is designed to make use easier and to increase efficiency during beam time.},

abstract = {The phase problem is a persistent bottleneck that impedes the structure-determination pipeline and must be solved to obtain atomic resolution crystal structures of macromolecules. Although molecular replacement has become the predominant method of solving the phase problem, many scenarios still exist in which experimental phasing is needed. Here, a proof-of-concept study is presented that shows the efficacy of using tetrabromoterephthalic acid (B4C) as an experimental phasing compound. Incorporating B4C into the crystal lattice using co-crystallization, the crystal structure of hen egg-white lysozyme was solved using MAD phasing. The strong anomalous signal generated by its four Br atoms coupled with its compatibility with commonly used crystallization reagents render B4C an effective experimental phasing compound that can be used to overcome the phase problem.},

abstract = {Pivotal to the regulation of key cellular processes such as the transcription, replication and repair of DNA, DNA-binding proteins play vital roles in all aspects of genetic activity. The determination of high-quality structures of DNA-binding proteins, particularly those in complexes with DNA, provides crucial insights into the understanding of these processes. The presence in such complexes of phosphate-rich oligonucleotides offers the choice of a rapid method for the routine solution of DNA-binding proteins through the use of long-wavelength beamlines such as I23 at Diamond Light Source. This article reports the use of native intrinsic phosphorus and sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods to solve the complex of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) bound to its interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). The structure unexpectedly shows three molecules of the IRF4 DBD bound to one ISRE. The sole reliance on native intrinsic anomalous scattering elements that belong to DNA-protein complexes renders the method of general applicability to a large number of such protein complexes that cannot be solved by molecular replacement or by other phasing methods.},

@article{Hatti2021,
abstract = {SAD phasing can be challenging when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such cases, having an accurate estimate of the substructure content can determine whether or not the substructure of anomalous scatterer positions can successfully be determined. Here, a likelihood-based target function is proposed to accurately estimate the strength of the anomalous scattering contribution directly from the measured intensities, determining a complex correlation parameter relating the Bijvoet mates as a function of resolution. This gives a novel measure of the intrinsic anomalous signal. The SAD likelihood target function also accounts for correlated errors in the measurement of intensities from Bijvoet mates, which can arise from the effects of radiation damage. When the anomalous signal is assumed to come primarily from a substructure comprising one anomalous scatterer with a known value of f′′ and when the protein composition of the crystal is estimated correctly, the refined complex correlation parameters can be interpreted in terms of the atomic content of the primary anomalous scatterer before the substructure is known. The maximum-likelihood estimation of substructure content was tested on a curated database of 357 SAD cases with useful anomalous signal. The prior estimates of substructure content are highly correlated to the content determined by phasing calculations, with a correlation coefficient (on a log-log basis) of 0.72.},

abstract = {Long-wavelength pulses from the Swiss X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) have been used for de novo protein structure determination by native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (native-SAD) phasing of serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) data. In this work, sensitive anomalous data-quality indicators and model proteins were used to quantify improvements in native-SAD at XFELs such as utilization of longer wavelengths, careful experimental geometry optimization, and better post-refinement and partiality correction. Compared with studies using shorter wavelengths at other XFELs and older software versions, up to one order of magnitude reduction in the required number of indexed images for native-SAD was achieved, hence lowering sample consumption and beam-time requirements significantly. Improved data quality and higher anomalous signal facilitate so-far underutilized de novo structure determination of challenging proteins at XFELs. Improvements presented in this work can be used in other types of SFX experiments that require accurate measurements of weak signals, for example time-resolved studies.},

abstract = {Although the success of molecular-replacement techniques requires the solution of a six-dimensional problem, this is often subdivided into two three-dimensional problems. REMO 09 is one of the programs which have adopted this approach. It has been revisited in the light of a new probabilistic approach which is able to directly derive conditional distribution functions without passing through a previous calculation of the joint probability distributions. The conditional distributions take into account various types of prior information: in the rotation step the prior information may concern a non-oriented model molecule alone or together with one or more located model molecules. The formulae thus obtained are used to derive figures of merit for recognizing the correct orientation in the rotation step and the correct location in the translation step. The phases obtained by this new version of REMO 09 are used as a starting point for a pipeline which in its first step extends and refines the molecular-replacement phases, and in its second step creates the final electron-density map which is automatically interpreted by CAB , an automatic model-building program for proteins and DNA/RNA structures.},
